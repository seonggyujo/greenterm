//! Opening greenterm on a folder. The Explorer menu "Open in greenterm"
//! runs `greenterm.exe "<folder>"`.
//!
//! - First launch: the folder is kept here and the frontend takes it for
//!   its first pane (`take_launch_dir`).
//! - Launch while greenterm is already running (release builds use the
//!   single-instance plugin): the new process exits and the running window
//!   gets an `open-folder` event, so the folder opens as a new pane there.
